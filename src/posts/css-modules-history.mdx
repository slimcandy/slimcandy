_CSS Modules just work_. That was the answer to my junior questions: How do they
work in my [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev) project and where do I find docs.

## TL;DR

- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) is a library hosted
  in GitHub
- [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) is a library
  hosted in GitHub. It uses `postcss` which uses `react-css-modules` which
  implements CSS Modules
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/) includes css-loader as
  thrid-party package.
- [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev) includes webpack.

[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) is the interface, no
real usage in your project.
