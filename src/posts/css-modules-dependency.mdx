_CSS Modules just work_. That was the answer to my junior questions: How do they
work in my [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev) project and where do I find docs.

## TL;DR

1. [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) is a specification
   hosted in GitHub.
1. [`postcss-modules`](https://github.com/madyankin/postcss-modules) is a
   PostCSS plugin to implement CSS Modules.
1. [`css-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/#modules) is a
   library hosted in GitHub. It uses `postcss-modules`.
1. [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/) includes css-loader as
   thrid-party package.
1. [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev) includes webpack.

## Gotchas

Working with [`classnames`](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames) library
mind that it doesn't support class nesting. It needs
`:global(.someNestedClass)`.

### Example

**./description.module.scss:**

```scss
.descriptionList {
  :global(.desriptionTerm) {
    color: red;
  }
  :global(.descriptionDetails) {
    color: green;
  }
}
```

**./DL.tsx:**

```tsx
import { descriptionList } from './description.module.scss'

const DL = () => (
  <dl className={descriptionList}>
    <dt>Red</dt>
    <dd>Green</dd>
  </dl>
)
```
