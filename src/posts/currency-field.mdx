Making input field for currency, it feels naturally to use dead-simple `type='number'` input. But it's extremely user-unfriendly. Look at common _gotchas_ below.

1. Surprisingly the best option is `type="text"` field. Since we want to accept float number with custom decimal symbols (`,` or `/`), [`type="number"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number#allowing_decimal_values) is not the solution. Mind that `type="number"` still [may allow characters](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1398528).

1. Problem of mobile digit Keyboard could be solved with native [`inputmode="decimal"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inputmode).
1. Keep next in mind, choosing the right library:

   - what decimal symbols it accepts (`,`/`.`/`;`)
   - where it places minus sign (`$ -45` or `-$ 23`)
   - how it handles leading zeros

     Popular solutions:

     - [`react-number-format`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-number-format) - mind how [leading zeros work there](https://github.com/s-yadav/react-number-format/issues/588#issuecomment-958634908);
     - [`imask`](https://github.com/uNmAnNeR/imaskjs) - it's a bit raw, but support is quick and [reachable via telegram (ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º)](https://t.me/imaskjs).

1. Could be useful to make local version. I made a simple [input currency field boilerplate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/input-currency-field) npm package.
